RTI-COALITION GHANA·WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 2017·READING TIME: 1 MINUTE

The Coalition on the Right to Information (RTI) Ghana wishes to congratulate Hon. Gloria Akuffo on her appointment as the Attorney-General (AG) and Minister for Justice. 

The Coalition would also like to use this opportunity to draw the attention of the Hon. Minister to the Right to Information (RTI) Bill. The Bill was laid before the 6th Parliament in 2013 but could not be passed before that Parliament lapsed on 7th January 2016 although extensive work was done on it. 

We recall that the Hon. AG while speaking as Minister Designate during her vetting on 21st January 2016 before the Appointments Committee, gave assurances that she will ensure that all documents brought to her table is dealt with. 

It is our hope that the AG will give priority to the RTI Bill and that His Excellency, President Nana Akufo Addo will ensure that the Bill is referred to Parliament as soon as possible, hopefully in his first hundred days. 

The Coalition remains committed to working with the AG and all stakeholders to ensure the speedy passage of a Right to Information legislation in Ghana.

ISSUED BY THE COALITION ON THE RIGHT TO INFORMATION, GHANA, JANUARY 30 2017
