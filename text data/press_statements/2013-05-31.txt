PRESS STATEMENT: RTI COALITION CALLS ON PRESIDENT MAHAMA TO ACT ON THE RTI BILL

The Coalition on the Right to Information (RTI) has sent a letter to President John Dramani Mahama, requesting him to take action to ensure that the Right to Information Bill is laid before Parliament once again.

The Ghana Right to Information Bill has been going back and forth between respective governments over the past 10 years. It was finally placed before Parliament on February 5, 2010 and was later referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committees on Communication and Constitutional, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs to be examined. The Bill is currently with Cabinet in accordance with the Standing Orders of the Parliament of Ghana which specifies that all bills pending before the last Parliament be reverted to Cabinet. Thus, the Executive would have to re-lay it before the 6th Parliament of the 4th Republic.

In a letter addressed to the President and dated May 28, 2013, the Coalition has appealed to President Mahama to expedite action and ensure that “the RTI Bill is presented to the honourable House for consideration.” The Coalition also called on President Mahama to be motivated by the campaign promises he made during the 2012 general elections that he would sign the Right to Information Bill immediately it was presented to him - and re-lay it before Parliament.

Meanwhile the Coalition proposes that before the President returns the bill to Parliament, government must review the bill by taking into consideration the numerous amendments proposed by the Coalition and accepted by the Parliamentary Joint Committees of the last Parliament.

The Coalition on the Right to Information is a network of civil society organisations working for the passage of a democratic RTI law that empowers the people’s right to information and enhances government accountability to citizens.
